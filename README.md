This app was built using the angular hottowel seed as a starting point. (https://github.com/johnpapa/generator-hottowel)
Main reasons for using this as a starting point:
* gulp scripts for bringing server up/down and running unit tests, building project
* frontend boilerplate for setting up angular routes etc.
* basic express boilerplate
Other than that, I threw away the included frontend services and most other structures.
Summary of frameworks used:
* AngularJS (Frontend JS)
* Semantic (CSS Framework)
* Express
* NodeJS
* MySQL
* Gulp (Scripting)
